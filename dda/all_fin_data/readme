clean contains data from fin_words_eval
noisy contains data from noisy with the same clean files, but with babble noise added at 0dB, 8dB, and 25dB (25dB doesn't really exist, I just copied clean files here with that label for our pseudo nearly-clean data)

Both of these were given to us by Tamas, with some modifications. 

The data in both files are split into train and test. They are split such that 20% of the files are in the test directories.
