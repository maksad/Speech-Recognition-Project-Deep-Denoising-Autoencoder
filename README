TIMIT contains timit data + python codes in the TRAIN and TEST folders to upload mfccs of all phonemes in joblib files.

check_phoneme_rec_err.py and check_pesq compares target, reg and source files in the enhanced directory with phoneme error rate and pesq values respectively 

phoneme_rec.py is the recognizer, trained on timit data. 

training_data.joblib and testing_data.joblib contain the timit data mfccs as generated by the scripts within the timit directory

plot_confusion_matrix.py can be used to plot confusion matrix after generating them with the phoneme recognizer 

figures contain a few plots that could be useful for the report


in the data folder, all_fin_data is Tamas's data, which I've organized a bit and into clean and noisy directories
