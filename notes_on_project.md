### Questions to be addressed in the research project
* Train the network with clean speech, use that network as base for training with noisy speech.
* Train the network with one language and test it on another
* Train the network with two languages and test it on both + a third language
* Randomize your training data with both clean and noisy speech. Eg. if noisy is given clean should be the output. If clean is given, clean should be the output.


### Literature study: Deep Denoising Autoencoder for Speech Enhancement
* Speech Enhancement Based on Deep Denoising Autoencoder, https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/archive_papers/interspeech_2013/i13_0436.pdf
* Exploring multi-channel features for denoising-autoencoder-based speech enhancement (if you decide to use multichannel data)
* Joint training of front-end and back-end deep neural networks for robust speech recognition
* Tensorflow implementation: https://github.com/jonlu0602/DeepDenoisingAutoencoder
