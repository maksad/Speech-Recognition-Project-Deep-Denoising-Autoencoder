### Questions to be addressed in the research project
* Train the network with clean speech, use that network as base for training with noisy speech.
* Train the network with one language and test it on another
* Train the network with two languages and test it on both + a third language
* Randomize your training data with both clean and noisy speech. Eg. if noisy is given clean should be the output. If clean is given, clean should be the output.
